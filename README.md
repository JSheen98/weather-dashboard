# Challenge 6: Weather Dashboard

## ✏️ Description 

With this project, I wanted to create a useful resource for travelers to view the current day's weather, as well as the next 5 days. The user will input a search (it must be a valid location), and then press the search. The previously searched location(s) will be persisted to the page via local storage, and will be clickable. Weather a previous location is tapped, or a new location is searched, the weather cards will be dynamically created via JavaScript. These cards include the following information: Location, Date, Icon Representation of the current weather, Temperature, Wind Speed, and Humidity. Each new search will generate new content.

## User Story

* AS A traveler
* I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
* SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly


## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
* WHEN I search for a city
* THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the searc history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
* THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
